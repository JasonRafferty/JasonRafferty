Jason's GitHub Bio 👨‍💻

Hello there! 👋 I'm Jason, a software tester with a background in chemical engineering. 🔬 My journey into the world of coding began during my dissertation, where I utilized MATLAB and a genetic algorithm to predict the growth of microalgae. 🌱 From here, I found my passion for software development and decided to pursue it further.

Currently, I'm actively engaged in the software testing domain, focusing on automation processes in Java ☕. As I continue to hone my skills in Java, I'm eager to embark on exciting projects that challenge my abilities and contribute to the coding community. 💻

Join me on my journey of growth and exploration as I strive to evolve from a software tester to a proficient software developer. Together, we can learn, create, and make a positive impact in the world of software development. 🚀

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out for collaboration or discussions. Let's connect and make great things happen! 😊
